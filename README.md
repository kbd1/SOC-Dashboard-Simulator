## New SOC-Focused Project: SOC Dashboard Simulator

A Python-based tool that simulates basic SOC functionalities, such as:

	•	Log Monitoring: Parses mock system logs for suspicious activities.
	•	Alerting: Sends notifications for anomalies.
	•	Visualization: Uses matplotlib or dash to show graphs of log trends.


## Todo: enhance this script with:
	•	Integration of real-time log processing (e.g., using Kafka or ELK stack).
	•	APIs for third-party integrations.
	•	Role-based access controls for SOC analysts.
